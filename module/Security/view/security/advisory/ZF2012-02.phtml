<h2>ZF2012-02: Denial of Service vector via XEE injection</h2>

<p>
    <code>Zend_Dom</code>, <code>Zend_Feed</code>, <code>Zend_Soap</code>, and 
    <code>Zend_XmlRpc</code> are vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion (XEE) vectors,
    leading to Denial of Service vectors. XEE attacks occur when the XML DOCTYPE
    declaration includes XML entity definitions that contain either recursive or
    circular references; this leads to CPU and memory consumption, making Denial
    of Service exploits trivial to implement.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    All locations where <code>SimpleXML</code> or <code>DOMDocument</code> were
    used with user input were patched. The patches mitigate the XEE vector by
    first calling <code>libxml_disable_entity_loader()</code>, and then looping 
    through the <code>DOMDocument</code> children, testing if any are of type 
    <code>XML_DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE</code>; if so, an exception is raised and 
    execution is halted.
</p>

<p>
    Where <code>SimpleXML</code> is used, the XML is loaded first via 
    <code>DOMDocument</code> and scanned as noted above; once validated, the
    <code>DOMDocument</code> instance is passed to 
    <code>simplexml_import_dom()</code>.
</p>

<p>
    This patch has been applied starting in versions 1.11.13 and 1.12.0 of Zend 
    Framework, and has been ported to the upcoming version 2.0.0 development
    branch (and first released with 2.0.0rc4).
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    If you are using either <code>Zend_Dom</code>, <code>Zend_Feed</code>, 
    <code>Zend_Soap</code> or <code>Zend_XmlRpc</code> in your projects, we 
    recommend <b>immediately</b> upgrading to 1.11.13 or greater.
